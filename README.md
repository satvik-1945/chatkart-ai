# ChatKart AI

ChatKart AI is an AI-powered conversational commerce assistant targeting vendor‚Äìcustomer interactions.  
It integrates **Rasa** for structured dialogue, **Ollama LLM** for reasoning and inference, and **MongoDB** for dynamic vendor-specific product data.  
The bot can operate on messaging channels like **WhatsApp Business** or **Facebook Messenger**.

## üì¶ Components

### 1. **Rasa NLU & Core**
- Handles **intent classification** and **entity extraction**.
- Manages structured **dialogue flows** for predictable conversation.
- Runs as a **Docker container** (`rasa` and `rasa-actions`).

### 2. **MongoDB**
- Stores:
  - Vendor product inventories
  - Customer details
  - Knowledge for retrieval
- Each vendor‚Äôs dataset is isolated, allowing the bot to serve **vendor-specific responses**.

### 3. **LLM Service (Ollama)**
- Runs inside its own container.
- Provides **reasoning ability** and answers that require inference.
- Will later integrate **retrieval from MongoDB** for context-aware answers (currently context is hardcoded for testing).

### 4. **Flask Messenger/WhatsApp Webhook**
- Receives incoming messages from Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp.
- Forwards text to Rasa for parsing.
- If fallback is triggered ‚Üí sends to LLM Service.
- Sends responses back to user via Messenger API.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Current Flow

1. User sends a message via **Facebook Messenger** or **WhatsApp**.
2. **Flask Webhook Service** receives the message and verifies token (Facebook webhook verification).
3. Message is sent to **Rasa NLU** for intent/entity recognition.
4. If:
   - **Intent is known** ‚Üí Rasa follows its dialogue flow.
   - **Requires reasoning** ‚Üí Forwarded to **Ollama LLM Service** (with optional hardcoded context for now).
5. Response is sent back to the messaging platform.
